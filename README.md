# asyBEM
Exploit high-frequency scattering asymptotics in a Boundary Element Method.

The script makeVb1.m in the folder `matlab' constructs the eigenvector of a full cycle of reflections between two circles. This is used by the script phase2Circles to validate our symbolic results. The Sagemath worksheet LimitCycleTwoCircles.sws computes these symbolic coefficients.
